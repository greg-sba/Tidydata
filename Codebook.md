Background on original data and transformations
=======================================================================================================================
The data which will be used for the project were obtained from the following study:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws

In the study, experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The original files obtained from the study include:

    'README.txt'

    'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

    'features.txt': List of all features.

    'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

    'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

    'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

    'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

    'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

When the original data were combined into a single data frame it had 10,299 rows(observations) and 561 variables.

Tidydata1 - this file contains 10,299 observations and 81 variables.  It was created by selecting only variables that contain the words Subject, Activity, mean or std in the name. (according to step 2 in the instructions).  These data contain the original measurements captured during the course of the original study.

Tidydata2 - this file contains 180 rows (30 subjects x 6 activities) and 81 variables.  It was created using the package "reshape2" and using functions "melt" and "dcast" to calculate means of the measurement variables (3:81) identified by Subject and Activity.  These data contain the mean values calculated on the original observation data.
